## Business Task
Did you know that a whopping 115 million kilograms of pizza are consumed daily worldwide? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway‚Ä¶) Inspired by the concept of "80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!" on Instagram, Danny launched Pizza Runner. To secure funding for his Pizza Empire expansion, he "Uberized" pizza delivery, recruiting runners and developing a mobile app with funds from maxing out his credit card.

## Dataset

![Pizza Runner](https://github.com/katiehuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/81607668/78099a4e-4d0e-421f-a560-b72e4321f530)

The dataset includes:

- `runners`: This table displays the registration date for each new runner.

- `customer_orders`: Captures customer pizza orders, with one row per pizza in the order. The pizza_id corresponds to the ordered pizza type, while exclusions are ingredient_id values to be removed, and extras are ingredient_id values to be added.

- `runner_orders`: After orders are received, they are assigned to a runner. Some orders may be canceled. Pickup_time is the timestamp when the runner picks up pizzas from Pizza Runner headquarters. Distance and duration fields indicate the travel required for delivery.

- `pizza_names`: Pizza Runner offers only two pizzas: Meat Lovers or Vegetarian.

- `pizza_recipes`: Each pizza_id has a standard set of toppings used in the pizza recipe.

- `pizza_toppings`: This table lists all topping_name values with their corresponding topping_id value.

## Data Cleaning

### Table: customer_orders

Looking at the `customer_orders` table below:
- In the `exclusions` column, there are missing/blank spaces ' ' and null values. 
- In the `extras` column, there are missing/blank spaces ' ' and null values.

<img width="1063" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129472388-86e60221-7107-4751-983f-4ab9d9ce75f0.png">

To clean the table:
- Create a temporary table with all the columns
- Remove null values in the `exclusions` and `extras` columns and replace them with blank space ' '.

````sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  customer_id, 
  pizza_id, 
  CASE
	  WHEN exclusions IS null OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
	  ELSE exclusions
	  END AS exclusions,
  CASE
	  WHEN extras IS NULL or extras LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
	  ELSE extras
	  END AS extras,
	order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;
`````

The clean `customers_orders_temp` table now looks like the below and we will use this table to run all our queries.

<img width="1058" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129472551-fe3d90a0-1e8b-4f32-a2a7-2ecd3ac469ef.png">

## Table: runner_orders

Looking at the `runner_orders` table below:
- In the `exclusions` column, there are missing/ blank spaces ' ' and null values. 
- In the `extras` column, there are missing/ blank spaces ' ' and null values

<img width="1037" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/129472585-badae450-52d2-442e-9d50-e4d0d8fce83a.png">

To clean the table:
- In `pickup_time` column, remove nulls and replace with blank space ' '.
- In `distance` column, remove "km" and nulls and replace them with blank space ' '.
- In `duration` column, remove "minutes", "minute" and nulls and replace them with blank space ' '.
- In `cancellation` column, remove NULL and null and and replace with blank space ' '.

````sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE runner_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  runner_id,  
  CASE
	  WHEN pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
	  ELSE pickup_time
	  END AS pickup_time,
  CASE
	  WHEN distance LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
	  WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM('km' from distance)
	  ELSE distance 
    END AS distance,
  CASE
	  WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('mins' from duration)
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('minute' from duration)
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM('minutes' from duration)
	  ELSE duration
	  END AS duration,
  CASE
	  WHEN cancellation IS NULL or cancellation LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
	  ELSE cancellation
	  END AS cancellation
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;
````

Then, we alter the `pickup_time`, `distance` and `duration` columns to the correct data type.

````sql
ALTER TABLE runner_orders_temp
ALTER COLUMN pickup_time DATETIME,
ALTER COLUMN distance FLOAT,
ALTER COLUMN duration INT;
````

The clean `runner_orders_temp` table now looks like the one below and we will use this table to run all our queries.
